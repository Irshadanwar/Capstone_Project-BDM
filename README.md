# Capstone Project - Business Data Management (BDM)  
This repository contains the completed project for the Business Data Management (BDM) course at **IIT-Madras.** The project focuses on **The Young Mug**, a quick-service restaurant in Kolkata, aiming to boost revenue, improve customer retention, and optimize inventory through data-driven insights.

## Project Overview  
The project analyzed **sales, customer feedback, and inventory data** collected from The Young Mug. The key challenges identified were **slower sales growth, inconsistent customer retention, and inefficient inventory management.** The objective was to uncover insights from the data and provide actionable recommendations to enhance profitability and operational efficiency.

## Data Collection and Cleaning  
- **Data Sources:** Two primary datasets were collected:  
  - **Sales data:** Orders, items sold, and total sales amounts.  
  - **Customer feedback data:** Ratings based on price, taste, and quantity.
  - **dataset:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eEg2sigebBZupTMD0lVoDXGE0EGwKZv5r5bjGgTvwCU/edit?usp=sharing**

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Handled missing values and outliers using filtering and conditional formatting in **Excel.**  
  - Standardized and organized data to ensure consistency and accuracy for analysis.

## Data Analysis  
The analysis was conducted using **Excel** to extract insights and create visualizations. Key analysis steps included:  
1. **Sales Analysis:**  
   - Generated daily aggregate sales data using line charts to reveal sales trends across weekdays and weekends.  
   - Created a pie chart showing the percentage of sales for each day of the week to highlight sales patterns.  

2. **Customer Feedback Analysis:**  
   - Analyzed ratings for **price, taste, and quantity** to identify strengths and areas of improvement.  
   - Used conditional formatting to distinguish high and low ratings, identifying customer satisfaction levels.  

3. **Inventory Analysis:**  
   - Created a stacked column chart to visualize revenue contributions from each menu item.  
   - Identified high and low-selling items, enabling data-driven inventory optimization.

## Results and Recommendations  

### Key Findings:  
- **Sales Insights:**  
  - **High sales on weekends** indicate potential for targeted weekday promotions to boost revenue.  
  - **Fridays recorded the lowest sales** at 5.1%, signaling a need for promotional strategies.  

- **Customer Feedback Insights:**  
  - Customers rated **quantity and price** favorably, but **taste** needs improvement to enhance satisfaction and retention.  

- **Inventory Insights:**  
  - **Veg momos, paneer momos, and cheese pizza** were the highest-selling items.  
  - **Masala maggi, cold coffee, and veg sandwiches** had low sales, suggesting opportunities to optimize stock and reduce costs.  

### Recommendations:  
- **Sales Strategy:** Implement weekday promotions and combo offers to boost sales during off-peak days.  
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Focus on improving the taste of low-rated items while maintaining affordability.  
- **Inventory Optimization:** Increase stock of high-selling items and reduce holding of underperforming products, potentially cutting costs by **40-50%.**
